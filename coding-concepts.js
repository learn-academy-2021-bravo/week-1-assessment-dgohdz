// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding conceptual questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------1) What will this log?

// var cohort = "Bravo 2021"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: It's going to log characters as numbers.
// b) Verify and explain: it gave me the number 10. I though it would count from 1 to 10.


// --------------------2) What will this log?

// var greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[3])

// a) Your answer: Will log "Hello World" 3 times.
// b) Verify and explain: It logged the 3rd character of "hello" since its index 3


// --------------------3) What will this log?

// var languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
// var index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: log will output "Ruby"
// b) Verify and explain: Index starts at zero, so Ruby is considered the 2nd character of the index.


// --------------------4) What will this log?

// var weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: will come back as error
// b) Verify and explain: The characters "saturday & "sunday" are indexed.


// --------------------5) What will this log?

// var dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: Will return string
// b) Verify and explain: Returns with "number". Not sure why. Couldn't understand "typeof"
